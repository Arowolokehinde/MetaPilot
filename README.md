#  MetaPilot

MetaPilot is an AI-powered Web3 assistant that automates on-chain actions on behalf of users. Built using the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit (ERC-7715) and Gaia infrastructure, MetaPilot allows users to delegate actions such as voting on DAO proposals, claiming rewards, and executing token swaps, all while they are offline.

## üîÑ System Flow

1. **User connects MetaMask** using the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit (DTK).
2. **User sets preferences** such as "Vote YES if the proposal includes rewards."
3. **Backend** stores rules, monitors events (using The Graph, Snapshot, CoinGecko, etc.).
4. **AI Engine** matches events (e.g., a proposal with "rewards").
5. **Action Composer** constructs a valid ERC-7715 action for the required task (e.g., vote YES).

DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/metapilot
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
GAIA_API_KEY=your-gaia-api-key
```

#### Frontend `.env`

```env
REACT_APP_GAIA_API_KEY=your-gaia-api-key
REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

## üß† AI Engine Details

* **Objective**: The AI Engine uses NLP techniques to parse proposal descriptions and match user preferences.
* **Implementation**:

  * Simple keyword matching using the OpenAI API or basic NLP models.
  * User-defined conditions (e.g., "vote YES if proposal contains 'reward'") are evaluated when new events are detected.
* **How It Works**:

  1. The engine listens to proposals or events.
  2. When a match occurs, it triggers the backend to generate the corresponding ERC-7715 action.

---

## üîí Smart Contracts

### Key Smart Contracts

1. **ActionExecutor**:

   * Handles and executes delegated actions (e.g., voting, claiming rewards).
   * Verifies the signature and permission scope (ERC-7710).

2. **DelegationRegistry** (Optional):

   * Tracks delegations (ERC-7710) that define which actions a user can delegate (e.g., vote on specific DAOs).

3. **RelayGuard**:

   * Restricts what actions can be executed based on predefined permission rules.

---

## ü¶ä MetaMask DTK Integration

1. **Session Key**:

   * A unique key generated when the user connects MetaMask.
   * Used to authorize actions and secure communications between MetaPilot and MetaMask.

2. **Delegated Actions**:

   * ERC-7715 actions are constructed and signed by the backend and Gaia Agent for execution on behalf of the user.

---

## üåê Gaia Integration

* **Gaia Agent**:

  * Persistent agent infrastructure that handles the execution of actions when the user is offline.
  * It signs and submits ERC-7715 actions to the blockchain on behalf of the user.

### How Gaia Works

1. The backend sends a task to Gaia Agent.
2. Gaia authenticates using the session key.
3. Gaia signs the action and dispatches it to the Ethereum network.
4. The backend receives feedback (success/failure), and the frontend displays the result to the user.
